1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I want to share my work and see what others think about it.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can pull from whatever position /branch I want to. If git do it automatically, I will get all the commits/branches even if I dont want them.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: when you want work on one's repository which wont allow you to make changes directly on it. You fork to your own repository and then clone to computer and work.

Clone: You want to work on a repository from github onto your own local machine. Clone it, work and commit.

Branch: you want to add some new feature or fix a big, dont want to do it on main/master branch.
