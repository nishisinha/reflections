1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It says initial commit, and we do it for making manual commit.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is area where we keep those files which need to commit. It offers intermediate place where file stays just before commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

As soon as I made a logical change, I will move the file to stagiing area and then commit it. This way I can ensure all the commits are neither too small and nor too big.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you want to change some files like you want to add a new experimental feature, fix a bug  and you dont want your original repository should change, we branch. Branch and make some changes.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps you to visualize commits and their parent commits, branches and any unrelated commit.

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Result will be all the common commits plus new added commits. It will be convenient to put in a diagram.

7.What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

pros: It merges two branches when some thing new added to them automatically
cons: for conflicts it asks the user to resolve it
